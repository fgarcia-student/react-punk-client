# CSS

We will be using sass to style our application.

SASS is a CSS preprocessor, adding functionality to CSS that allows for variables, functions, and many other features.

The styling methodology we will be using is BEM (Block Element Modifier)

The SASS architecture we will be following is a slightly modified 7-1 pattern.
