// This would ultimatly be comprised of many containers (or connected components, whatever you'd prefer)
// This page would simply be a logical layout of each page 
// as it pertains to the application

// example:
// home page consists of 2 sections A, B
// A and B are both containers for a and b which are presentational components

// our goal is to make these components as small and reusable as possible
